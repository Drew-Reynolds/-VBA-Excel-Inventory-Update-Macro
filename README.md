This was a project for my Fortify Depot intership. It took an Excel file given from a supplier and converted it into one ready to be given to the storefront. It had 5 main sections:

1. Remove unnecessary fields
2. Get the index of important fields
3. Calculate the selling price of each item
4. Adjust prices if they're below the MAP price
5. Verify all prices are above the MAP price, flag any that aren't

For context, the MAP price is the minimum acceptable price set by the supplier, and Fortify Depot isn't allowed to sell at a price lower than that.
